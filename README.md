Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

*By analyzing these campaigns and multiple factors such as creation dates, set goals and demographics, we uncovered great details to maximize a campaign's success and ensure the fundraiser goal is met.*

#### ***Statistical Analysis Results***

*In the Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx you will be able to appreciate how the optimal period of time to launch a Kickstarter Campaign is during Q2, in particular during May where the success rate is 67% (8% over vs the rest of the year's average in Q1 and Q3)*
