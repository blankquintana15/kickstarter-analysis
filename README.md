## kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

*By analyzing these campaigns and multiple factors such as creation dates, set goals and demographics, we uncovered great details to maximize a campaign's success and ensure the fundraiser goal is met. This Analysis will focus on fundraisers for Theater and Plays*

#### ***Statistical Analysis***

*In the Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx you will be able to appreciate how the optimal period of time to launch a Kickstarter Campaign is during Q2, in particular during May where the success rate is 67% (8% over vs the rest of the year's average in Q1 and Q3)*

- May 67% Success rate
- June 65% Success rate

*On the other hand, October and December are not recommended months to start a fundraiser due to the increase of failed campaigns during these months exceeding the yearly average*

- October 43% Failure rate
- December 46% Failure rate
- January 7% Cancelation rate vs 2% average during the rest of the year

#### ***Correlation of funding goal vs success rate***

*While considering different factors, we also focused on the funding goal impacts and how different ranges could contribute to the success or failure of each campaign.*

- 73% of all fundraisers equal or less than $4999 achieved the goals set
    - Success rates continue decreasing when paired with higher funding goals
